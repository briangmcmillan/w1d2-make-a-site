        Brian McMillan was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on January 12th, 1991 into a family of four. Parents Robert and Melinda, and siblings Jimmy and Sarah. In 1996, the McMillans moved south to Martinsville, Indiana where he spent his childhood. Graduating from Martinville High School in 2009, Brian decided to attend the Kelley School of Business at IUPUI in downtown Indianapolis. He graduated with a B.S. Degree in Business Marketing in 2014 and quickly took his talents to Angie's List.
        <br></br>
        Brian worked three-years as an eCommerce Sales Consultant, achieving numerous sales awards for his hard-work. He felt like he needed a new challenege though and decided to enroll in the Front-End Engineering program through <a href="https://www.theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a>. He is currently in the middle of his first of twelve weeks. Each day have proven to be the challenge he was searching for. There are no signs of it letting up either, but he has confidence that this process will not only lead him to a new, and exciting career-path, but will most definitely make him a stronger person when it's all said and done.
        <br></br>
        Brian enjoys spending his free time with family and friends. He attends dinner once a week with his parents, sister, and her two children Ty and Laila. He loves being an Uncle and hanging out with the kids. His parents are his rolemodels. They have provided nothing but love and support for him his whole life. His parents taught him to have a strong work-ethic, to respect others, and above else never be afraid to fail. His sister Sarah, taught him how to be resilient in the face of tough times. Nothing gets her down and that has rubbed off on him. Brian also has a tight-knit group up friends. They share his same enthusiam for sports, music, entertainment, and have the same drive for their careers. They all push each other to become as successful as they can be. Their plan someday is to all own a beach property together so that they may vacation together with their families.
